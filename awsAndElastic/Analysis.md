### Description of Case Study
For more than a couple of years, Elastic and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have been embroiled in an infringement fracas with Elastic, the owners and providers of the Elasticsearch code base alleging AWS of unethical use of their service. (See `https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-license-change-aws`) The Elasticsearch service is an open source code which AWS had as far back as 2015 adopted, modified and integrated into their oher services which they offered as a paid service to their customers under the name Amazon Elasticsearch Service, all without contributing to the original code base.

### Elastic License Change
After years of lawsuit, AWS and Elastic recently settled their disputes with Elastic modifying their [Elastic License ELV2](https://www.elastic.co/licensing/elastic-license). The prominent changes in this new license includes:
* Making it impossible for third party companies to provide Elasticsearch as a paid service
* No one can modify the license key functionality or tamper with features protected by license keys
* Strengthening the licensing and copyright notices of the service.

Responding to these new sets of restrictions on the Elastic License, Amazon went ahead to create and launch the Amazon Opensearch Service which replaces the Elasticsearch service for its customers. The Opensearch service, like its predecessor is a highly scalable system that provides fast access to large data volumes and comes with an integrated visualisation tool. More information on this service is contained in [OpenSearch by Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-amazon-opensearch-service-which-supports-opensearch-10/).

### Relaibilitty of the AWS Stack
Amazon Web Services (AWS) OpenSearch is a highly reliable and scalable search service that is designed to handle a large number of search queries and indexing requests. It is built on top of the same infrastructure that powers other AWS services, which are known for their high availability and durability.

AWS OpenSearch is designed to automatically scale up or down based on the volume of search queries and indexing requests, so it can handle fluctuating workloads without requiring manual intervention. It also provides various features and tools to help you monitor and optimize the performance of your search service, such as the Search Insights and CloudWatch metrics.

Additionally, AWS OpenSearch is backed by a 99.9% uptime service level agreement (SLA), which means that it is guaranteed to be available and fully operational at least 99.9% of the time. This means that you can rely on AWS OpenSearch to provide a high-quality search experience for your users.
